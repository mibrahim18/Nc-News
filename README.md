# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

The database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

######

As .env.\* is added to the .gitignore, anyone who wishes to clone the repo will not have access to the necessary environment variables.

In order to to create the environment variables. Creat 2 files, one named .env.test and the other named .env.development.

Within these files add the code PGDATABASE=<name of relevant database>
